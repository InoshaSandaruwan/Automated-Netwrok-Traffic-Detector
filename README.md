# Automated-Netwrok-Traffic-Detector
I developed a Network Traffic Detection System using Wireshark, Scapy, and Python to monitor real-time network traffic. The system detects port scans, UDP scans, ICMP anomalies, and other suspicious activities, providing real-time alerts to assist network admins in identifying potential security threats.
